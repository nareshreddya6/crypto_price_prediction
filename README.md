# crypto_price_prediction
=======
Install requirements
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn
tensorflow
python-binance

steps followed to buil the project:

1.In main.py, integrate with the Binance API to fetch historical price data
2.In models/model.py, implement data preprocessing and normalization
3.Implement an LSTM model in models/model.py
4.Add prediction and backtesting logic in main.py(ensure you have fetched and saved your historical price data)
5.Use Matplotlib to visualize the predictions against actual prices 

The output contains metrics like 
1.accuracy 
2.percentage
3.profit/loss if traded
4.graph of actual prices vs predicted prices
